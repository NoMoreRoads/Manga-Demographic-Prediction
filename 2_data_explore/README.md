## Data Exploration

*NOTE: see the [full project readme for additional context](https://github.com/NoMoreRoads/Manga-Demographic-Prediction/tree/main); this is a sub-project of a larger undertaking.*

This Jupyter Notebook utilizes Pandas and other Python libraries to explore the data obtained from AniList, with an eye towards imputing missing values, feature engineering, and eventually leveraging classification algorithms to predict the demographic label. 

The notebook also performs some data wrangling tasks, as the data extracted from the API is not fully formatted the way we need to perform useful analysis.
