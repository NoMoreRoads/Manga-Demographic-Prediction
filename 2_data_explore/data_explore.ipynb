Missingness in start_year, status and source did not clearly correlate with any features.\n",

This provides us with valuable insight for how we might handle missing values in these features in the future.\n",

    "Source missingness seems to be slightly positively correlated with finished manga, and slightly negatively correlated with start_year. This might indicate that older manga (which might be more likely to be finished) are less likely to have fans on the site who have taken the time to add a source label.\n",

    "Missingness in the demographic label (which will comprise the manga whose labels we would like to predict) is positively correlated with being from Korea, the full color tag, and the boys' love tag. The country correlation makes sense to me, as I believe the demographic labels we are using for this project are largely a Japanese invention. For the full color tag, I hypothesize that a manga being from Korea and being full color is highly correlated, based on my previous experience as an AniList user. Consulting with a colleague about the boys' love association, it seems that boys' love may be in some ways be considered a demographic category in its own right, as it sounds like there may be [boys' love specific magazines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dear%2B) in Japan.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Further Research\n",
    "More investigation into the mechanism for missingness in the future may involve additional sampling from outside AniList to find the characteristics of the missing data, and whether it differs from the data we have access to. Additionally, performing Little's Test in order to check if data is missing completely at random. Finally, if it seems likely that we have missing at random data, validating this by checking the characteristics of missingness within defined groups.\n",

These features mainly provide additional information in context with one another, as with the popularity-scaling features.\n",

    " - Shounen and number of volumes, the action genre, having an anime adaptation, and the size of supporting and main casts are positively correlated.\n",

    " - Seinen, the nudity tag, and the ecchi genre are positively correlated.\n",
